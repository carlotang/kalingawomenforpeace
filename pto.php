            <p class="content">The researchers were Asian Peacebuilders scholars who undertook dual master’s program at
                the
                United Nations Mandated University for Peace (UPeace) in Costa Rica and Ateneo de Manila University
                (AdMU)
                in the Philippines. Mark Anthony G. Articulo and Ataur Razaq took up MA in International Law and the
                Settlement of Disputes, while Miki Sakiyama took up MA in Gender and Peacebuilding at UPeace. The three
                of
                them finished Master in Transdisciplinary Development at AdMU. Their capstone project reflects a
                thoughtful
                and necessary fusion of the academic disciplines they have embarked on.
