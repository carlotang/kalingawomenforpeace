            <h1 class="title">THE KALINGA SOCIETY:</h1>
            <h4 class="subtitle">Networks of Harmony and Systems of Amity</h4><br>
            <p class="content">Located within the mountainous zones of the Cordillera Administrative Region, the
                province of
                Kalinga adheres to political structures cultivated by their culture. In their society, harmony rules and
                amity prevails. Kalinga is home to forty-six (46) ancestral domains <b><i>(bugis)</i></b>,
                separated by
                clearly drawn
                borders. Amidst the diversity in the province, communities are governed by unifying political systems
                structures embedded in folkways and mores. Found at the core of these legislative, executive, and
                judicial
                patterns are the law of peace and order.</p>

            <p class="content">Decision making along with enforcement of rights to ancestral domains is fulfilled by the
                <b><i>Umili</i></b>. These are individuals residing in <b><i>ili</i></b>, whose
                primary
                functions are
                managing
                conflicts and resolving
                disputes, intra, and inter village. <b><i>Ili</i></b> is the ancestral domain serving as a
                contiguous
                residential area
                where houses are built on individually owned home lots called <b><i>sa-ad</i></b>. The
                territorial
                jurisdiction of <b><i>ili</i></b> is
                called <b><i>bugis</i></b>. It may or may not correspond to political boundaries.
                Additionally,
                <b><i>pagta</i></b>
                constitutes the
                terms and conditionalities mutually agreed upon by both parties of the <b><i>podon</i></b> and
                delineates
                the domain of
                the <b><i>ili</i></b>. Kalinga indigenous political systems cover cultural practices,
                processes,
                and
                norms of conduct
                geared towards the common good.
            </p>

            <p class="content">On the other hand, <b><i>pangat</i></b>
                <i>(plural-<b>papangat</b>)</i>
                represents
                leadership that’s upheld by insight
                and promotes justice. Though the title is usually reserved for the elders, the <b>pangat</b>
                is
                neither chosen by
                them nor elected by the people, as it is also not invested or inherited – except for the
                <b><i>bodong
                        holders</i></b>.
                Respectability is earned through intelligence, physical prowess, leadership traits, and innate
                abilities.
                Integrity and wisdom are also integral criteria. <b><i>Pangatship</i></b> in the Kalinga
                community
                is a
                distinguished
                class in the society. However esteemed the position is, they cannot dictate the affairs of their
                community
                without prior consensus based on collective opinion. However, there are specialized functions of the
                “Papangats or Lallakay” that are rooted in culture and traditions.
            </p>

            <p class="content"><b><i>Bodong/Podon/Vochong/Pochon</i></b> System is the prime institution that
                ruled over
                the relationship
                of tribes in all ancestral domains of Kalinga. Its goals are economic stability, social security, and
                cultural preservation. Bodong holders serve as the implementer of <b><i>pagta</i></b> and make
                joint
                decisions with
                villagers. When an inter-tribal disagreements arise, the <b><i>mansasakusak or
                        mangkakaron</i></b>
                arbitrates the conflict
                with the help of elders from neutral tribes. An object of dispute settlement is the “nakorwidisan ne
                panay,”
                an heirloom porcelain bowl entwined in rattan that is given to the offended party. Reconciliatory in
                nature,
                resolving family feuds also sometimes involve <b><i>pippiya</i></b> (betrothal) where parties
                give
                their
                children in
                marriage. Generally, the Bodong system ensures that disputes are peacefully resolved.

            </p>

            <p class="content">The Kalinga society also has networks of harmony that encourage cooperation and fortifies
                unity. These include <b><i>Pango/Bataris, Botad, Bolig, Sarop, Killo-Ong,</i></b> and
                <b><i>Badang</i></b>.
                These mirror the
                fundamental
                values of cooperation and unity in the Kalinga communities and are a reflection of the collaborative
                nature
                of the indigenous political structures. People work together to achieve a common goal. If men are
                workers
                and leaders, women are considered peacemakers and life-givers. To avoid ruin and curse to the tribe,
                they
                are accorded respect and courtesy. Similarly, Kalinga folks perceive the use of their fertile lands as a
                social and spiritual responsibility.
            </p>

            <p class="content">Ba-in, Ngilin, and Paniyaw are the core values found at the heart of Kalinga society –
                beating with respect for oneself, others, and their properties and territory. These unwritten codes lead
                the
                people into a fruitful life, living meaningfully both in social and spiritual realms. Well-rooted on
                indigenous structures in their community, folks of Kalinga stand stronger in their pursuit of a peaceful
                society.
