            <p class="content">To live in peace and social security with the belief of advancing towards economic
                prosperity
                and social stability if peace is achieved has always been the end goal of tribal communities in the
                Cordilleras. Empowering the members of the tribe whilst embracing peace was Benedicto’s way of leading
                their
                tribe towards reaching greater heights.

            </p>

            <p class="content">Benedicto Sugguiyao of the I’Kalinga, Lubo subtribe has borne the title of <i>Nangdon si
                    Bodong</i>
                for more than two meaningful decades after inheriting the position from his father. Benedicto believes
                that
                <i>Bodong</i> has been the primary peace institution from practices by certain ethnic groups in Kalinga
                that
                governs the relationship between two tribes with the specific territorial jurisdiction.

            </p>

            <p class="content">
                To enforce the provisions of the PAGTA and exercise stewardship over the tribesmen of the
                counterpart village has been Benedicto’s cardinal duty as the <i>Bodong</i> holder. It is stipulated in
                the
                ethnic
                constitution that the leaders of both tribes should protect each other’s members as their own. As a
                matter
                of fact, the host tribe shall be held responsible should there be any unfortunate instances that may
                arise
                during their stay in the territory.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                For so long, Benedicto’s journey of being the peace pact holder has not been smooth-sailing at all.
                According to
                him, there are various trials and tribulations he faced in maintaining the peace and harmony between the
                two
                tribes. Collectively, he believes that there are two striking obstacles he defied in his decades of
                serving.
                It
                is, first, responding to the need of maintaining peace and amity by and between two tribes and looking
                for
                peaceful solutions whenever there is conflict, and second, finding ways on how to balance the indigenous
                way
                of
                settling disputes and the local statutes and national laws.

            <p class="content"><b>Opinion about Women Peacepact Holders</b></p>
            <p class="content">

                Benedicto believes that men are more capable of becoming <i>Bodong</i> holders because men are more
                physically-equipped
                to maintain the balance of terror and to protect the village from incursions in case of tribal
                conflicts.
                This
                belief stems from the ancient and conservative perception of their elders that being the <i>Nangdon si
                    Bodong</i>
                should only be held by men. Traditionally, <i>Bodong</i> has always been only for men. Women, on the
                other
                hand,
                carry
                the responsibility in food, pots, and merrymaking. Women only join in celebrations as food servers and
                entertain
                the guests with songs and dances during the rituals.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                However, Benedicto takes a rapid paradigm shift and considers women being peace pact holders; only that,
                there
                are no women ‘takers’ in his tribe. He dreams of seeing women taking up space in a once male-dominated
                environment in the future, although he is not sure whether women are interested in being <i>Bodong</i>
                holders.

            <p class="content"><b>Young Generation of the Kalinga</b></p>

            <p class="content">

                Contrary to popular belief that the younger generation of indigenous people tends to ignore their
                cultural
                values, Benedicto sees a bright future for the Kalinga community. He believes that the interest among
                the
                youth
                in participating in the <i>Bodong</i> process is increasing. This is due to the fact that indigenous
                knowledge
                systems
                and practices are now a mandate of the curriculum enshrined among secondary and tertiary learning
                institutions.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Benedicto further emphasized that the placement of representatives of the Mandate of Indigenous Peoples
                in
                all
                regional legislative bodies has also made an impact on the resurgence of attention in culture and the
                arts.
                Convincingly, he feels that it has aroused considerable interest among the younger generation
                considering
                the
                <i>Bodong</i> celebration as a major cultural carrier.
