            <p class="content">
                We, the researchers, owe a great deal to the people of Kalinga for allowing us to conduct our study
                about
                Bodong, which is a tradition emblematic of their dreams and aspirations to live a life of amity, peace,
                camaraderie, and prosperity.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                We extend our profound gratitude to our local partners—Atty. Minerva R. Magtanao-Taguinod, Atty.
                Catherine
                Gayagay-Apaling, and Atty. Zorayda Mia Wacnang—whose time, resources, and networks they have selflessly
                shared
                with us since the inception of our Capstone Project. Without them, we would have encountered
                insurmountable
                difficulties in accomplishing our Capstone Project.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                The center-piece of our Capstone Project is the documentation of the lives of three respectable,
                courageous,
                and
                empowered women—Carina Chulsi, Elena Baglinit and Irene Addamo—all of whom have dedicated their lives in
                the
                service of their tribes. During the interviews, they have generously imparted their stories, including a
                vivid
                recollection of the challenges and triumphs they have faced in their stints as peace pact holders. They
                have
                inspired us tremendously and we know that their stories are worth sharing to the world. Our gratitude to
                them
                and their families is immeasurable.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                We also pay heartfelt tributes to the Kalinga elders whose wisdom and inherent knowledge of the Kalinga
                culture
                and tradition have deeply enriched our Capstone Project: Pastor Luis L. Ao-as (Basao Subtribe),
                Benedicto
                Sugguiyao (Lubo Subtribe), Imelda Payao (Tobog Subtribe), Segundia Magtanao (Dallac Subtribe), Beatrice
                Canao
                (Balinciagao Subtribe), Naty Sugguiyao (Lubo Subtribe), Jane-ai Lomas-e (Uma Subtribe), Remedios Baltao
                (Lubuagan Subtribe), William Puday Sr. (Sumadel Subtribe), and Felix Puday (Butbut Subtribe).
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Our heartfelt gratitude also goes to the young bloods of Kalinga—Marcel Wangiwang, Fe Marie Sibayan,
                Christine
                Rose Likigan, Reyzle Marie Grayle Balinte, Kimberlee Linggayo, Carlo Magsilao, Kairan Dona-al
                Aggalao—who,
                through their candid remarks and insightful reflections, have allowed us to look at Bodong from a
                different
                but
                worthwhile perspective.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                We likewise thank the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (Kalinga) for helping us obtain the
                consent
                of
                the various Kalinga tribes through their elders. The NCIP has been helpful in facilitating our
                compliance
                with
                government rules and regulations, which aim is to uphold and respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples in
                any
                research undertaking. Same gratitude is also extended to the Matagoan Bodong Consultative Council
                (MBCC),
                who,
                through its head, Engr. Andres Ngao-I, shared how the Bodong was institutionalized within the structure
                of
                Tabuk
                City government.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                The Provincial Tourism Office of Kalinga, under the dynamic leadership of Ms. Lorraine Allunday Ngao-I,
                has
                allowed us to use their fantastic collection of photos, thus dispelling our worries of not being able to
                do
                a
                photo shoot due to the pandemic and border restrictions. The amazing photos have indeed adorned our
                documentation. Thus, expressing our deep appreciation to the Tourism Office is also in order.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                We similarly thank Ariel G. Quegan and Christian L. Dulin for their writing and editing proficiency,
                Charlemagne
                Villacorte and J Sephel Eliphaz Egipto for their excellent skills in web design, and Eric John Calagui
                for
                his
                splendid drone shots. Their efforts have been indispensable in realizing the principal output of our
                Capstone
                Project.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Lastly, but certainly not least, we give our huge appreciation to our Capstone Advisers, Dr. Mary
                Racelis
                and
                Dr. Enrique Nino P. Leviste, whose erudition have adroitly guided us throughout the project planning up
                to
                its
                implementation. We value deeply their words of encouragement that have certainly fueled our desire to
                create
                an
                output that will impact the lives of the people of Kalinga.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                We are immensely grateful to all those mentioned, but we enter the obligatory caveat that while their
                inputs
                have significantly helped us in coming up with the website whose accuracy we have painstakingly strived
                to
                achieve, we are alone responsible for the inaccuracies or errors that remain.
