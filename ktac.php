                There are rugged hills to climb, unique flavors to devour, history to review, picturesque

                Before the emergence of modernized civilization, headhunting was once regarded as a noble
                pursuit and
                symbolized bravery for the natives. Hence, headhunters became the identity interlinked with the natives
                of
                this landlocked province. It was then a warrior society that accorded tattoos as status symbols awarded
                to
                warriors which men respected and as these warriors earned tattoos, women's admiration was earned as
                well.
                But it’s not all violence and tribal wars that prevail most in this pristine land, there’s more than
                meets
                the eye!

                The province's name evokes a very cultural
                mindset as it stimulates curiosity about this untouched gem. Aside from waging violence, one might be
                thinking of Apo
                Whang-Od of the Butbut tribe in the town of Buscalan. Whang-Od is a traditional tribal tattoo artist
                that
                locals refer to as ‘the last mambabatok.’ For more than 80 years, Whang-Od has been inking headhunters
                from
                her tribe long before she started inking tourists. Known for having the prestigious Dangal ng Haraya
                Award,
                Whang-Od became one of the major representations of the province, and arguably even the face of the
                Cordilleras. At the same time, one might even be acquainted with the tragic story of Lumnay and Awiyao
                written by one of the pillars of Contemporary Philippine Literature, Amador Daguio. Daguio was a native
                of
                Lubuagan, ergo; his stories are heavily influenced by local color and Kalinga customs and norms.

                One fact that distinguishes them; first-timers might be in awe when they see peculiar-shaped tombs of
                their
                deceased family members. Accordingly, they
                observe year-long mourning, which restrains the deceased's closest relatives from eating certain kinds
                of
                food. Then, widows and widowers must not marry within this period. At the end of mourning, a feast is
                prepared with wine, music, and Kolias or song. Culture has set almost everything for natives. Another
                thing
                to note is the notable Kalinga house; the foruy in Bangad, Tinglayan is a house elevated by posts.
                Unlike
                modern houses today, their shape can either be square or rectangular. Inside it is a single room and
                split-bamboo flooring which can be rolled up.<br><b><i> (Credits to the owner of the photo,

                the
                mountains and villages of Tinglayan, Tanudan, Tabuk, and Lubuagan. You will also love to mark your next
