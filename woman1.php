                Deep into the highlands of Kalinga lies the quaint village of Sumadel. Almost forty years back, this
                village
                witnessed a killing that ignited what was then believed to be a seemingly enduring tribal war between
                the
                Sumadel Tribe and the Butbut Tribe. Boys from the latter were identified as the perpetrators of the
                assassination of incumbent Mayor Alexander Alñgag. This tragic incident elicited an immediate reaction
                of
                the Mayor’s son, Alexander Alñgag, Jr., killing Peter Gaddawan of Butbut in Tuguegarao, Cagayan in
                mid-1980.

                In Bodong, it is a cardinal norm that the peace pact is automatically severed once a killing or
                <i>patoy</i>
                is
                committed against a member of a <i>kabodong</i> (tribe with which the other tribe forged a peace pact).
                What
                normally ensues after the severance is a killing spree, where one tribe aims to score evenly against the
                other.
            </p>
            <p class="contentLeft">
                This is exactly what happened between Sumadel and Butbut. The members of each tribe lived in constant
                danger
                as they were all rendered vulnerable to the vengeful acts of some of the members of the opposite tribe.
                Indeed, during the period following the severance of the Bodong, retribution and bloodshed supervened.
                This
                took place despite the presence of military elements in the municipality of Tinglayan, where Butbut and
                Sumadel are situated.
            </p>
            <p class="contentLeft">
                Besides, during the precarious period, tribe members who were working as government employees were
                forced to
                take a leave for two years for fear of losing their lives in the course of the tribal war. Others sought
                refuge in distant places. Children and youths were also not allowed to go to school as they were
                likewise
                susceptible to the violence of the tribal war.
            </p>
            <p class="contentLeft">
                Because of the worsening situation, the Office of the Provincial Governor of Kalinga had to intervene.
                Agustus Saboy, who was then the Provincial Administrator, was sent to Tinglayan to persuade the two
                tribes
                to negotiate and restore the peace pact. While the two tribes gave negotiation a chance, the atmosphere
                was
                overwrought.
            </p>
            <p class="contentLeft">
                As the negotiation was transpiring, the rest of the members of the Sumadel Tribe were anxious and in
                full
                anticipation. Many were profusely hoping that the peace pact will be restored. Among them was the late
                mayor’s older sister, Carina Alñgag Chulsi. For Carina, her tribe has already seen enough bloodshed and
                it
                was time for killings and other forms of violence to end as many lives have been stunted, including that
                of
                the younger generations of her tribe. Although she was still grieving over the loss of her younger
                brother,
                she knew that time has come for her tribe to restore the <i>Bodong</i> with the Butbut Tribe in order
                for
                the lives
                of everyone to go back to normal and for their children to be given the chance to go to school again.
            </p>
            <p class="contentLeft">
                The negotiations, however, proved to be difficult. Aside from irreconcilable terms and conditions being
                proffered by both tribes, the elders or the <i>papangat</i> of Sumadel were having a hard time
                identifying
                who
                would hold the <i>Bodong</i>. Apparently, none from the elders and other Sumadel males from Mayor
                Alñgag’s
                clan
                wanted to become the <i>Bodong</i> holder as they were afraid that they will not be able to carry the
                responsibility or control the members of the clan who were still bent to choose retribution over
                reconciliation. Many were frightened to take on the task since being a <i>Bodong</i> holder is not
                simply a
                social
                distinction, but it also implies a precarious social status and may mean life itself.

            <p class="contentLeft">
                On the third day of negotiation, Carina went to the rice fields with another woman to attend to their
                crops.
                When rains began pouring, Carina and her companion decided to go back home. Suddenly, the sky cleared up
                and
                an odd and scorching heat donned on the wide rice fields. Then Carina saw a group of men who were making
                their way out of Sumadel. She noticed that these were the elders of the Butbut Tribe. She hastily
                approached
                the group to ask why they are already leaving when the negotiation is still on going, to which the group
                retorted that no one among the males of her tribe wanted to hold the <i>Bodong</i> so it was futile for
                them
                to
                continue negotiating.
            </p>
            <p class="contentLeft">
                Frustrated of what she just heard, and determined to restore peace between the two tribes, Carina right
                there and then decided to hold the Bodong. She immediately headed back to her village and announced that
                she
                will hold the peace pact. While it came as a surprise to her family, Carina’s decision was however
                embraced
                by them considering that this will mean a great deal to both Sumadel and Butbut Tribes, whose members
                have
                been longing to see a day where they can live their lives free from fear and worry.
            </p>
            <p class="contentLeft">
                Negotiations then lasted for a few more days to settle the <i>pagta</i> or the rules of the
                <i>Bodong</i>,
                and as
                in other
                Bodong celebrations, a feast followed the successful negotiation. However, since trust has not yet been
                fully restored, members of the Butbut Tribe had to demand that they be given unbreakable objects before
                they
                could partake in the meals prepared by the Sumadel Tribe. It is a common belief that this would dispel
                any
                curse that they might get from eating the food. To show that they are sincere, members of the Sumadel
                Tribe
                allowed the Butbut Tribe to take with them cauldrons, cast iron pots and other metal objects.
            </p>
            <p class="contentLeft">
                Unbeknownst to Carina then, her extraordinary courage and resolute stance to revive a very expensive
                peace
                had made her the first woman peace pact holder, not only of Kalinga, but also of the whole Gran
                Cordillera.
                Petite as she physically stands, her valor, conviction, and strength of character are bigger than anyone
                could ever imagine. Carina personifies an empowered woman, who is ever ready to make big sacrifices if
                only
                to give her tribe members the peaceful and secure life that they deserve.
                Carina has become the source of inspiration for many people in her tribe, including her own beloved
                children. For her daughter Juanita, Carina has proven that in <i>Bodong</i> and elsewhere in life, women
                are
                not
                consigned to the kitchen. Women play enormous roles in conflict resolution and achieving peace. They
                possess
                assets and skills that are valuable in negotiating and restoring amity. They are cool-headed and could
                adjust in almost all situations since they can control their minds and emotions. In addition, when women
                speak amidst a pool of men, the latter would almost always lend their ears to the former as Kalinga men
                accord women great respect.
            </p>
            <p class="contentLeft">
                Indeed, Carina has trail-blazed the path to Kalinga women’s meaningful participation in <i>Bodong</i>.
                Her
                outstanding feat as the first woman peace pact holder heralded an era where Kalinga women can assert
                themselves in decision-making as regards socio-political issues that affect their lives and well-being.
                For
                that reason, Carina is deemed by many as legendary.
            </p>
            <p class="contentLeft">
                Today, Carina’s son, Ferdinand, is the holder of the <i>Bodong</i> that she has so gallantly fought for
                in
                the name
                of peace. Asked how he feels about her mother’s feat, Ferdinand responded with a brimming pride in his
                eyes.
                For him, what his mother did was a great act of sacrifice and an immense display of courage, and as his
                tribe’s current peace-pact holder, it is his joy to emulate and continue his mother’s gallantry. Being a
                <i>Bodong</i> holder is a huge responsibility, but Ferdinand sees his position as an opportunity to be
                of
                true
                service to his people and his tribe, and for him, there is no greater honor.
