            <p class="content">Owing to the need for a more inclusive justice system and reconciliation mechanism in
                Kalinga, an evolved peace code was developed – yTabuk Pagta.


            </p>

            <p class="content">To expand the traditional concept of Kalinga’s Pagta as a bilateral covenant, a task
                force,
                composed of representatives from various Kalinga communities and non-Binodngan (non-Kalinga) ethnic
                groups,
                formulated this novel model of an agreement between tribes. Anchored on the framework of the Kalinga
                Bodong
                Congress, yTabuk Pagta was improved into a more unified code of peace, which is aimed at promoting
                greater
                harmony between and among the tribes in Tabuk City.
            </p>

            <p class="content">With the end goal of promoting equality and eliminating the perception of discrimination
                during the settlement of disputes between Binodngan and non-Binodngan groups, yTabuk Pagta was crafted
                as an
                answer to the call of migrants, who established their homes in Tabuk City, to be included in Kalinga’s
                justice system. Formulated and adopted to be an inclusive instrument for settlement of conflicts and
                resolution of disputes, it may be applied to and invoked by all yTabuk living in the City of Life.
            </p>

            <p class="content">Encompassing a total of 21 sections concerned with different problems/issues/crimes
                related
                to gender-based violence and discrimination, Article X is one of the important features of the enhanced
                peace code because it deals with Crimes against Women and Children. Originally defined and found in a
                traditional Pagta, Pugod/Gubao (rape), Lugung (seduction), Sokwao/Daladag (adultery), Lukluk/Lobak
                (desecrating a widow/widower), Toddak di Babbai, abduction, and corruption of minors are some of the
                offenses or crimes stated in Article X. National laws, such as Anti-Violence against Women and their
                Children Act, and Anti-Bullying Act of 2013, also became a fundamental foundation for the definition of
                the
                other felonies included.


            </p>

            <p class="content">Atty. Zorayda Mia Wacnang, one of Tabuk City’s councilors, was privileged to be actively
                involved in the drafting of the yTabuk Pagta. As an empowered politician and lawyer, she was part of a
                group
                of women leaders and women representatives, whose task was to discuss and draft the Article on Crimes
                against Women and Children. The issue of women’s limited participation in the community peace process
                was
                raised during their discourse, making them realize that they need to take active positions and
                engagements
                in fortifying peace in their respective communities and tribes. Taking into account that women and
                children
                are the ones who are most affected by tribal wars and community conflicts, Atty. Wacnang believes that
                women
                must be given more opportunities to have their voices be heard, participate in dispute resolution, and
                assert their rights. Fortunately, collective efforts are now directed toward getting more women involved
                in
                peace-keeping mechanisms.



            </p>

            <p class="content">The convergence of different tribes and ethnic groups, and also the heightened
                participation
                of women, for the formulation of an enhanced peace code, prove that Kalinga is now on its way to
                strengthening an inclusive justice system and resolution structures. With this, yTabuk Pagta is truly
                Kalinga’s evolved unifying peace code.
