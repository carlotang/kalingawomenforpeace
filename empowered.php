                Bestowed with beauty and grace, women are esteemed by many. But beyond that respect ascribed to them,
                they
                have so much more to offer than good looks and lovely gestures, because they can achieve great feats
                with
                their power and strength.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Women, with their increased participation in significant endeavors, have asserted their vital presence
                in
                various aspects of society. Even their role in cultural systems has now been recognized as valuable
                because
                women are taking up space. And this is true for the women of Kalinga, who are empowered and illustrious,
                just like Atty. Catherine Gayagay-Apaling.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Working as the Provincial Officer of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) in Kalinga,
                she
                says that using their customary justice system, which is bodong, in resolving conflicts or disputes has
                always been inscribed in their ethnic society. It serves as the peace-oriented mechanism that is
                practiced
                by indigenous communities since time immemorial. Proven to be effective in quickly resolving disputes
                between villages, Bodong will continue to be part of indigenous people’s systems. It allows the tension
                between communities at odds with each other to subside and be peacefully settled. In these activities,
                women
                do not usually participate in the process but are informed of the end results of the agreement.

            </p>
            <p class="content">
                The political structure of Kalinga lacks positions for women to actively participate in the actual
                negotiation or resolution of the conflict. Most, if not all, negotiators/mediators (mansasakusak) are
                male
                elders/leaders that come from neutral tribes. However, Atty. Catherine was privileged to be given the
                rare
                opportunity to actively engage in the negotiation of the Butbut-Betwagan Boundary Conflict Resolution,
                as a
                member of the Provincial Task Force.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Unfortunately, the resolution of the conflict was not achieved since the community members involved are
                not
                ready to meet halfway because of their emotional highs. Atty. Apaling learned that dealing with disputes
                demands a lot of time, effort, and patience. Along with that, she also realized that support and
                guidance
                from government agencies won’t do much in peacefully managing disputes if the opposing tribes are not
                yet
                ready to settle their conflict. These external forces don’t have sufficient influence or authority
                because
                they can’t impose the tribes to make peace with each other. Good thing is the conflicting tribes
                requested
                the Provincial Task Force to give them time to discuss with their respective indigenous cultural
                communities
                what decision they should make. Unless there is mutual agreement between them, the conflict will remain
                unresolved.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                During the deliberations, when the community members gather to make a consensus decision regarding the
                proposition or counter offer of the other tribe, women are given the chance to be engaged in the
                meeting.
                That makes their participation indirect and subtle. The community’s decision is represented to the
                negotiators by the elders.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Taking all of these into account, it is Atty. Catherine’s hope that Kalinga women as empowered as they
                are
                now, will take a more active role in the negotiation for peace from today onwards. Women deserve to
                participate in the community’s decision making, especially in matters affecting their ancestral domain/
                ancestral land, and in all aspects of their life and rights as indigenous peoples/indigenous cultural
                communities of Kalinga.
