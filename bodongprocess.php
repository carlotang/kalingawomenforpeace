            <h1 class="title">THE BODONG BOND:</h1>
            <h4 class="subtitle">Building Connections, Promoting Peace</h4><br>
            <p class="content">Conflicts between clans and troupes can either lead to unresolved tension or settled
                agreement. For the communities of Kalinga, the latter is more preferred and their desire to clear up
                disputes is manifested in <strong><i>Bodong</i></strong>. Bodong is a bilateral agreement between two
                groups, both seeking a
                harmonious relationship with each other. In the process of resolving their struggle, both parties abide
                by
                these steps in forging Bodong.
            </p>

            <p class="content"><strong><i>Patigammo/Pagikna</i></strong> <i>(to make known)</i>. One of two tribes
                engaged
                in a
                bloody clash needs to
                explore peace feelers and initiate the building of a Bodong <i>(bumdongkani)</i>. An uninvolved member
                of a
                <i>sin-ilian</i> (autonomous tribe), chosen by the initiating group, transmits the message. The
                <i>papangat</i>
                (headmen)
                of the other village assemble to deliberate whether to accept or decline the proposition. If they agree,
                a
                favorable response will be transmitted. The exchange of spears or <i>Allasiw or Sipat </i>happens after
                both
                parties have signified their willingness to forge the Bodong.
            </p>

            <p class="content"><strong><i>Allasiw/Sipat</i></strong> <i>(exchancing weapons for peace)</i>. The
                <i>papangat</i>
                (headmen)
                and <i>Angkamalong-ag</i>
                (elders) will gather to choose among themselves a <i>mangdon si Bodong</i> (peace pact holder), one from
                each side.
                The Bodong holder is sought from a large <i>singkapuun</i> (kindred), and must be
                <i>maalmmot/maasngan</i>
                (fierce
                warrior), <i>masingnan</i> (respected by the tribe), and <i>baknang</i> (wealthy), since he’s expected
                to
                protect
                his
                community. This represents the presence of peace in the two villages and their mutual responsibility
                over
                their people’s security. Once both tribes have chosen, the holders’ symbolic <i>say-ang </i>(spears) are
                exchanged.
            </p>

            <p class="content"><strong><i>Silgip</i></strong>. To consummate the <i>Allasiw</i>, it is celebrated.
                <i>Silgip
                    or
                    simsim</i>
                (to taste) informs that
                both sin-ilians accepted the Bodong. To determine if the chosen peace-pact holder is destined to fulfill
                the
                responsibility, a pig is butchered and its liver is examined. The elders read <i>(abig) </i>it and if
                it’s
                favorable, they discuss previous grievances, and share a meal, then the agreement to forge the Bodong is
                publicly proclaimed. If the liver doesn’t show good omen, another qualified holder is chosen. Once the
                <i>Allasiw</i> is concluded <i>(naisilgip)</i>, warnings on not harming or commit any crime against the
                other
                sin-ilian
                are made.

            </p>

            <p class="content"><strong><i>Inom/Lonok</i></strong> <i>(to drink or enter a village en masse)</i>. This is
                the
                culmination of the Bodong
                celebration. A social gathering is set when the two sin-ilians agree to hold it. The peace-pact holder
                shoulders a percentage of the expenses, community members give their <i>dagup/uyup</i> (share), cash or
                in
                kind.
                For the festivity, men are assigned to do physical tasks and butcher animals. Children serve as
                <i>alluwagi</i>
                (servers), while women do the kitchen chores. Everyone works together putting things in order after
                everything’s done. During the <i>inom</i>, the vibrant sounds of gong reverberate in the celebration,
                combined with
                dances, the <i>Ullalim</i> (chanting of Kalinga epic), <i>Sogsogma</i> (spontaneous chants),
                <i>palpaliwat</i>
                (speech to
                boast
                something) and community meals.


            </p>

            <p class="content">This step in forging Bodong involves many processes. (1) <strong>Pagta</strong>. The
                <i>inom</i> is
                highlighted by
                the enactment of the by-laws of the Bodong. <i>“Botak de mangmangwa ate lawweng adta anna e kabodongko”
                    (death
                    to anyone who does any harm to anybody on my counterpart)</i> is declared by the peace-pact holder.
                The
                provisions implemented in the pagta include komkom/potot, daladac, and wakwak. (2)
                <strong>Tumangad</strong>
                <i>(to raise one’s
                    head)</i>. It involves drinking sugarcane wine (basi) from a ceramic bowl <i>(payawyaw)</i>. (3)
                <Strong>Palpaliwat</Strong>.
                This form
                of entertainment and occasion is held to boast exploits and achievements.

            </p>

            <p class="content">After both tribes have culminated the <i>inom</i>, the Bodong is officially established.
                They
                are
                now perceived as <i>sunud</i> (borther or sister), since the pact built a connection more than just a
                friendship.
                The peace-pact holders are bound to protect the linkage by swearing <i>(sapata)</i> to kill anyone who
                breaks the
                agreement. Likewise, if one of his people is harmed, the Bodong holder is responsible for the avenging
                of
                the victims.


            </p>

            <p class="content">At this point of the process, the Bodong is officially forged and the <i>pagta</i> or
                simply
                the
                laws for ruling peace between the two tribes will be reinforced. If the communities aim to renew the
                peace-pact and warm their relationship, they hold <i>dolnat</i>, also to remind their respective
                constituents of
                the repercussions of violating the <i>pagta</i>. All things considered, the Bodong is a sacred deal that
                ensures a
                mutually beneficial relationship between two sin-ilians. Boundaries are drawn, laws are put in place,
                and a
                promise of respect and peace is sealed, all for the building of enduring connections and promotion of
                lasting peace. This is the Bodong link.
