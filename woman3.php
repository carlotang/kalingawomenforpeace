                It’s no secret that women have historically faced greater barriers than men when it comes to fully
                participating
                in their respective community. In Kalinga, being the leader of a tribe was once a male-dominated role
                but
                has
                drastically become gender-equal task through the test of time, and the story of Irene has proved worthy
                of
                not
                just being a peace pact holder but also a chieftain to her tribe.

            <p class="content">
                Irene Addamo, of the Sumadel tribe in Bulo, Tabuk City, Kalinga, holds a peace pact between her ethnic
                community
                and the Lubo tribe of Tanudan. She whole-heartedly inherited the title of <i>Nangdon si Bodong
                </i>(peace-pact
                holder)
                following the death of her husband in 2002. Even before her husband’s untimely demise, Irene had been
                helping
                his husband in fulfilling his duties and responsibilities as the tribal chieftain. His husband had a
                hearing
                impairment, so he required his wife's assistance in joining discussions. Irene believes that the peace
                pact
                should not only focus on men but should also be open to the entire family, especially the spouses. She
                pointed
                out that women need to take on much bigger roles to maintain and strengthen their Bodong.

            <p class="content">
                Since her succession, the 70-year-old Bodong holder is enthusiastic and nonchalant when it comes to
                decision-making. With the help and guidance of the council of elders in her indigenous tribe, her
                leadership
                has
                been smooth-sailing for the past 19 years. It has been peaceful, in fact, that she has never encountered
                any
                problems, challenges, and hard negotiations on her path. She believes that diverse experiences and
                perspectives
                contribute importantly to bringing innovation, as different perspectives lead to better decision-making.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Whenever there are some concerns and matters needed to be discussed, she would always consult and
                consider
                what
                the elders think before making a decision. Irene has a strong sense of trust among the elders and that
                she
                will
                follow the elders’ decisions even if they differ from her perspective. However, she emphasized that
                women
                should
                also be present whenever they discuss conflicts to share their opinions on certain issues, to listen,
                and to
                actually have their voices be heard.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Despite being a woman peace pact holder for nineteen years now, she still believes that men are more
                capable
                of
                being the <i>Nangdon si Bodong</i> because they have greater strength to defend their village on the
                battlefield.
                In
                her perspective, this makes men more able to be the protector, defenders, and leaders of their tribe.

            <p class="content"> <strong>Maintaining peace for the future generation</strong></p>
            <p class="content">

                More than the recognition and the indigenous tradition, Irene felt like it’s her responsibility to be
                the
                Sumadel tribe’s peace pact holder. For almost two decades of being an amity builder, it never crossed
                her
                mind
                to renounce her duty. According to her, the only time that she would pass her title to her eldest son is
                when
                she dies. Further, she wants the younger generations of her tribe to exercise and abide by the
                provisions of
                Pagta, even if Irene is already gone, as it is geared towards the holistic and maximal development of
                their
                members.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                This 19-year mission as a peace pact holder fulfills her and makes her happy because she has been
                contributing
                and maintaining peace between the Sumadel tribe and the Lubo tribe. As she feels proud of doing service
                for
                her
                tribe, the folks in her community also delight that they have her as a guardian of <i>‘peace.’</i>
