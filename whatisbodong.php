            <p class="content">There was a time when people would deliberately
                presume that the rugged mountainous terrains of Kalinga were home to vicious warriors and savages which
                inspired various tales and legends to this day. Decades of headhunting and countless records of waging
                wars
                with other tribes emboldened the elders to develop a peace-pact system as they desire to live in peace
                and
                social security with the belief of advancing towards economic prosperity and social stability if peace
                is
                achieved. Hence, Bodong came into existence.

            </p>

            <p class="content"> <img class="image" src="assets/images/bodong1.jfif">Bodong emerged as an intervention
                for
                lex
                talionis (law of retaliation) provision years ago.
                Back then,
                vengeance is justified as long as blood is drawn. Natives believe that if they don’t retaliate, they
                will
                always end up being taken lightly. This remedy determines the relationships of a tribe and its domain
                with
                another tribe and it mutually binds the law that grows the relationship of these tribes with each other.
                Further, crimes with no apparent danger such as stealing and the like can be resolved through series of
                peace-talks and intensive arbitration to make sure that a certain matter won’t be taken lightly.
                Whenever
                conflict arises, this unique justice system intervenes through the nangdon si Bodong (the peace-pact
                holder)
                who initiates the negotiations through an intermediary known as mansakusak to resolve the transgression.

            <p class="content">The practice of Bodong is guided by the pagta, which is either constituted orally or in
                writing, although
                the latter is the prevailing practice at present. Through the test of time, the peace-pact evolved as
                protection for traders and non-native merchants when they cross tribal borders. At present, Bodong is
                usually established when an individual member of a tribe or barrio has a business relationship with
                another
                person from the other tribe.
