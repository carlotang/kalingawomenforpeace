            <h4 class="subtitle">Kalinga’s Political Compass
            </h4><br>
            <p class="content">From the steep lands and agriculturally rich soil of Kalinga exists one of the world’s
                indigenous governments called the Bodong. Fortifying it as a recognized institution is the
                <strong><i>pagta</i></strong> or “law of
                the <i>Bodong”</i> – meaning peace covenant or pact. As the traditional Constitution and By-Laws of the
                Kalinga
                society, it serves as the political guide of <i>Bodong</i> community called <i>binodngan</i>.

            </p>

            <p class="content">As a bilateral covenant mutually agreed upon by the peace pact holders,
                <strong><i>pagta</i></strong> contains
                provision on the setting of territories – “Buguis” for the villages of the north and “Kai-is” for the
                communities south. The established limitations define areas of responsibility where internal and/or
                external
                troubles are dealt with. Moreover, there are also punitive provisions that are concerned with settling
                inter-village or community feuds and ensuring security of people and their belongings. Violations, such
                as
                the <i>Bug-uy</i> and the <i>Akaw</i>, involving injuries, bloodshed, theft, and death are included in
                these
                provisions.
                <i>Nangdon si Bodong</i> or peace pact holders are the ones responsible for the avenging of the offended
                party and
                the negotiable settlement of the dispute. For some people who don’t see the wisdom on these provisions
                of
                <strong><i>pagta</i></strong>, they roughly translate it as “an eye for an eye, and tooth for a tooth.”
                Hence, this segment of the
                political code is proposed to undergo certain amendments especially the <i>lex talionis</i> (law of
                retaliation)
                provision. But since it has strongly governed the Cordilleran domain for many generations, modifying
                portions of it has proven to become a challenge.

            </p>

            <p class="content">In a broader view of <strong><i>pagta</i></strong>, Kalinga’s political compass
                fundamentally
                functions as the
                instrument in maintaining peace and order in every ancestral domain of the province. Adhered to by the
                locals since time immemorial, it’s more than just a thing of the past handed down by word of mouth,
                because
                <strong><i>pagta</i></strong> is considered as a significant contribution of Kalinga to national
                cultural
                treasures.
