            <!-- <h4 class="subtitle">Building Connections, Promoting Peace</h4><br> -->
            <p class="content">For so long, indigenous people have been struggling as they strive to preserve their
                ancestral lands, protect their native language, and promote their dying culture. With the widespread
                liberalization around the globe, the norms and indigenous people are threatened to be displaced, making
                them
                more susceptible to insecurity and discrimination. Along with this hostile condition, ethnic people,
                specifically women may seem to drown in the world where men seem to dominate in every career aspect.

            </p>

            <p class="content">The indigenous justice systems vary from one region to another but there are things that
                are
                akin among them. Lack of government support and funding, and the inequality and gender-biased workspaces
                are
                some of these. There are some cases where women hold a special role in their ethnic tribes. Indigenous
                women
                have long proved that they are at par or arguably even better than men in mediating disputes.
            </p>

            <p class="content">In many Southeast Asian countries, indigenous people are excluded from law-making
                processes
                and the formal justice system. There are few institutions of formal legal services that enable
                indigenous
                people to file a case before a court. In case it is difficult for them to access the formal justice
                system,
                they have to rely on informal justice systems. However, indigenous justice systems are male-dominated in
                most cases and have no room for women to join. If indigenous women have no necessary safeguards, they
                remain
                highly vulnerable and cannot receive justice. This vulnerability is rooted in the fact that the
                collective
                rights of indigenous peoples and their limited representation, especially of women in the political
                arena
                are not recognized. Moreover, in this case, the states fail to perform their duty for their citizens to
                raise awareness on the subject of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
            </p>

            <p class="content">Meanwhile, in Latin America, political decision-making is still dominated by men but
                slowly,
                the presence of indigenous women is now being embraced. Also, in indigenous dispute settlement
                mechanisms,
                the participation of women has been expanded (e.g. Quechua women in Peru, Nasa women in Colombia, and
                Mayan
                women in Guatemala) but they are still an absolute minority among men. Gender bias indeed remains in
                indigenous dispute settlement, it focuses more on dialogue, listening to complainants and a broad range
                of
                parties involved in disputes, and seeks conciliated solutions. In their provisions, indigenous women do
                not
                need to encounter the discrimination, racism, and inefficiency that they tend to experience in the state
                justice system. This is a significant benefit for them. However, in the case of sexual and non-sexual
                violence, the great majority of women lack adequate access to the indigenous system due to the
                patriarchal
                nature of the justice system, and their economic dependency, and the social sanction against victims.
                Women
                leaders are prone to consider violence cases more seriously.

            </p>

            <p class="content">However, in Africa, a wide variety of ethnic groups and their traditional conflict
                resolution
                mechanisms can be observed. For example, in Ethiopia holding multiple ethnic groups and tribes,
                generally,
                women rarely become mediators even though they join the systems as plaintiffs or defendants. On the
                other
                hand, in Ambo Woreda of West Shewa Zone in Ethiopia, women can intervene and request reconciliation
                through
                their institution called siqqe. Further, in the early stage of conflicts, women can play the role of
                peace
                envoys for their district. Marriage is also another form of participation of women in dispute settlement
                that can be seen in several groups. In the Issa and Gurgura clans of Somali in eastern Ethiopia,
                marriage is
                a tool to bond two groups of people. For example, beautiful women marry into enemy tribes to heal the
                wounds
                of conflict and give birth to boys to make up for those lost in the conflict.


            </p>

            <p class="content">The overwhelming majority of decision-makers in indigenous dispute settlement mechanisms
                are
                men and the lower participation of women is the world phenomenon. Especially, women mediators seldom
                exist.
                Indigenous dispute settlement mechanisms can provide protection and access to justice, but a lack of
                women
                mediators seems to make women disadvantaged in some cases.
