                Confident in their abilities and certain of their power, women take on numerous roles in society. Taking
                up
                space and achieving great feats have been their primary ways of proving that they are worthy of esteem
                and
                are
                empowered to handle responsibilities, especially in leadership. This holds true to Elena, a peace pact
                holder in
                Kalinga, who illuminates her light to lead her land toward a peaceful life.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Designated by elders of the Biga tribe with a unanimous decision, Elena Baglinit holds a peace pact
                between
                her
                indigenous community and the Tanglag tribe in Lubuagan, Kalinga. Succeeding to the peace pact of her
                father,
                she
                came to learn about her functions as a peace pact holder through four community meetings. She believes
                that
                being the youngest child in her family was one of the reasons for her being selected.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                The 55-year old <i>Bodong</i> holder has her community’s trust as they believe that she is completely
                able
                to make
                good
                decisions for them. Perceived with high regard even before she accepted the responsibility, Elena
                committed
                more
                of her time and capabilities in helping people resolve their problems when she became their village’s
                peace
                representative. With her tribe’s confidence in her, it did not matter that she was a woman.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                <strong>Fulfilling her duties and responsibilities.</strong> Elena’s experience in problem-solving
                boosted
                her confidence
                that
                she could perform the task of dealing with conflicts since it’s her utmost mission to resolve community
                issues.
                As a leader with a functional moral compass, she always sides with the one who is right. Wealth or
                smartness
                does not influence her decision-making, because she sets aside biases to fairly support the people who
                are
                on
                the right side of situations.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Elena’s title heightened her sense of responsibility that’s why she strived to be a good role model to
                her
                community by being righteous in all her actions and gestures. Having urged her to be an image of good
                leadership
                for the folks to emulate, the <i>Bodong</i> she holds also elevated her alertness and sensitivity to the
                needs of
                her
                tribe members.

                <strong>Being a woman peace pact holder.</strong> Being the lone woman <i>Bodong</i> holder in her
                tribe,
                Elena
                believes that she
                was
                chosen because she’s a lesbian. As a female leader dealing with similar responsibilities and issues male
                peace
                pact holders manage, she has not encountered any problems based on the fact that she is a woman. Her
                sexual
                orientation essentially makes people consider that she can make a firm decision like a man.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Despite having the thought of men making firmer decisions than their female counterparts, Elena
                highlighted
                women’s superior skills in negotiation, especially concerning youth delinquents. In her viewpoint, they
                can
                deal
                better with the younger generation who are in conflict with what’s deemed right because women are
                generally
                more
                patient. She had observed and noted that children tend to be frightened of men, but that fear vanishes
                when
                a
                woman talks to them with compassion. Their supreme ability to sympathize and lengthen their patience
                proves
                that
                negotiation is one of the women’s strong points.

            <p class="content">
                <strong>Becoming a woman peace pact holder.</strong> A peace pact holder since 2018, Elena has already
                spent
                3 years dealing
                with
                both the successes and challenges of her role. She’s always trying her best to serve her people well.
                One
                instance where she exemplified good dispute settlement capability was when somebody from another tribe
                was
                stoned by someone from her tribe last year. The victim suffered injuries, but the worsening of the
                dispute
                was
                avoided because Elena dealt with the trouble. The one side had to perform certain rituals on behalf of
                the
                victim so that it would appease the other party and the tension might not heat up into something worse.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                One difficulty of holding a <i>Bodong</i> is that Elena is required to make herself available whenever
                and
                wherever
                she
                is needed, no matter what the circumstances are. No matter the time and place, she has to be there when
                duty
                calls.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Despite the struggles she encounters and the huge responsibility she carries, Elena remains steadfast in
                doing
                her job because she does not want to perpetuate violence. In the 1980s, the <i>Bodong</i> she holds was
                severed and
                came to a halt because the conflict between the two tribes led to bloodshed. Elena does not want to have
                that
                kind of war and violence, especially among the present generation. Good thing is that the peace pact was
                restored in 2018. Fuelled to be a protector of peace within and across tribes, she continues to do her
                work
                and
                justify her responsibility as a peace pact holder. For her, peace is tantamount to good life and peace
                of
                mind.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                <strong>Calling future women peace pact holders.</strong> Elena emphasizes that if Kalinga women want to
                become peace pact
                holders, they should be able to exemplify strength and wisdom in decision-making, be ready in all assets
                especially financially, be fearless and courageous, and be a very present help for the people.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Truly, Elena is an empowered woman who is worthy of being a peace pact holder. She lives up to the
                profound
                meaning of her name as she shares her brightness with her people toward a harmonious and peaceful life.
                Indeed,
                Elena is the leading ‘light’ of her land.
