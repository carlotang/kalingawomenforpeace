            </h4><br>
            <p class="content">When a <i>bodong</i> is forged, the <i>binodngan</i> or the members of the two tribes
                between
                which the
                peace pact was constituted are expected, for the sake of peace and harmony, to follow the laws or the
                “pagta,” and in case they violate these laws, they shall be held responsible for their transgressions.
                However, in all <i>binodngans</i>, certain individuals are charged with the special, albeit heavier,
                responsibility
                to enforce or execute the “pagta.” They are called the peace pact holders or “nangdon si bodong”.

            </p>

            <p class="content">Peace pact holders are the eyes, ears and mouth of the <i>bodong</i>. They have the duty
                to
                prosecute with dispatch the cases brought before them and they are expected to confer with the
                <i>umili</i>
                and the
                elders in making decisions. They shall not allow the severance of the <i>bodong</i> without complying
                with
                the
                provisions of the <i>pagta</i>.

            </p>

            <p class="content">
                Because they carry huge responsibilities, including economic duties, peace pact holders have to meet
                certain
                requirements before they are chosen as such by their tribes.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                In most cases, males are chosen as peace pact holders on account of the fact that, in the past, it is
                the
                males who actually go to the battlefield to fight in behalf of their tribes. For most members of the
                various
                Kalinga tribes, the males represent the stronger gender as they have the capacity to protect their
                tribes
                against physical harm.
            </p>

            <p class="content">

                Although physical strength is desirable for a peace pact holder to possess, in this present age as in
                the
                olden times, peace pact holders must be individuals who are respected in their communities and come from
                well-to-do families. The respect given to peace pact holders translates into an authority that enables
                the
                community to abide by their decisions. Thus, for peace pact holders to retain the respect and confidence
                of
                their fellow tribe members, they have to be upright in their dealings, show strength of mind in their
                decisions, and display compassion and empathy towards others.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Peace pact holders must also be financially capable considering that they are always expected to be the
                host
                during a <i>bodong</i> celebration or during the warming up of the <i>bodong</i> or what is called the
                <i>dolnat</i>. They are
                also expected to be the host of traveling <i>binodngan</i>, with the responsibility to feed, offer them
                shelter,
                and insure their safety and well-being.
            </p>

            <p class="content">

                However, the possession of the above traits is not a guarantee that one can become a peace pact holder.
                As a
                matter of tradition, peace pact holders become as such by virtue of inheritance. It is usually passed-on
                to
                the eldest son, and it is a rarity that it is passed-on to a daughter.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Nevertheless, despite the strong preference given to male children even up to this modern era, some
                females
                have risen above the tradition and played the roles as peace pact holders.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                In the above case, when the eldest son or the other sons beg off because the requisite traits are
                wanting,
                the daughter, who possesses the desired characteristics and capacities, may inherit the position. In
                some
                tribes, however, it is a condition that the husband of the daughter must come from their own tribe.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                Another way by which a woman can become a peace pact holder is when it is passed-on to her on account of
                the
                death of her husband, who was the previous peace pact holder. She will hold it until she dies or until
                she
                is already unable to perform the responsibilities that is expected of her.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                Outside the process of inheritance, a woman can also become a peace pact holder when the council of
                elders
                of her tribe selects her.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                Yet another way is when two tribes desire to reestablish a <i>bodong</i>, which was previously severed
                due
                to <i>patoy</i>
                or killing. In this instance, the elders of each of these tribes may select, as a matter of preference,
                the
                new peace pact holder—who may be a woman—from the relatives of the victim or the culprit (as the case
                may
                be).
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                Although some elders in some tribes are still strongly bound by tradition and still prefer males as
                peace
                pact holders, many women and even men, who are highly regarded in their respective tribes, have
                expressed
                that more women should be given the chance to become peace pact holders because they can be as effective
                as
                men. In fact, one peace pact holder observed that, when it comes to negotiation or settling issues
                involving
                younger generations, women peace pact holders are more effective because they tend to be more patient
                and
                compassionate.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                While gender parity in this aspect of Kalinga society is still far-fetched, it is important to emphasize
                that Kalinga women have, indeed, broken through a tradition that has been dominated by men for
                centuries.
                And while some members of the Kalinga society may have not noticed it, many of today’s <i>pagtas</i>
                between
                tribes
                have recognized the indispensable role of women in the attainment of peace, security and development,
                and
                thus encourage women to be <i>bodong</i> holders and to actively participate in all <i>bodong</i>
                undertakings.
                This
                declaration of principle, which now guides the practice of <i>bodong</i>, is a most welcome development
                that
                will
                enable more Kalinga women to assert their leadership roles in grassroots conflict resolution and
                peacebuilding mechanisms.
